## HomeAway Coding Challenge

In order to build the project, you must have Cocoapods installed.

`pod install`

Then open `Home Away Challenge.xcworkspace`

### Technologies Used

`Texture` (formerly AsyncDisplayKit) was used to create the UI for the app. https://texturegroup.org/docs/layout2-quickstart.html

`Realm` was used to store Favorites data: https://realm.io/products/realm-database

`PromiseKit` was added to provided Promises to the codebase. https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit

`Alamofire` for communicating with the SeatGeek API. https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire

I went for extra credit and created a Favorites tab and added some local events content in the empty screen of the search view.

Hope you enjoy!
